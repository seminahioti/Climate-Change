## Description
To practice what you’ve learned about window functions, you are going to use climate data from each state in the United States. A labeled map of the United States can be found here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_USA_with_state_names_2.svg

These data will show the average annual temperature for each state – this is the average temperature of every day in all parts of the state for that year.

For this project, you will be working with one table: state_climate
